# Online Banking Service System

This project is a desktop application developed using Java Swing AWT and MySQL with XAMPP for the database. The primary focus of this system is to provide customers with mini statements that detail all their transactions, including deposits and withdrawals. Given the constraints of not having direct connections with an actual bank, the system simulates deposit and withdrawal functionalities where customers can manually enter amounts to generate and display transaction histories.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application offers a user-friendly interface for customers to interact with their banking information.
- **Login and Sign Up:** Secure login and sign-up functionalities to manage user accounts.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal Simulation:** Simulated deposit and withdrawal transactions for demonstration purposes.
- **Balance Enquiry:** Allows users to check their current balance.
- **Mini Statement:** The standout feature of this project is the mini statement functionality that provides customers with real-time transaction history. This feature addresses the common customer need for quick access to transaction history without the delays associated with traditional banking methods.
- **Fast Cash:** Quick withdrawal options for predefined amounts.
- **Pin Change:** Enables users to change their account PIN for security purposes.
